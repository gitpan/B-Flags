NAME
    B::Flags - Friendlier flags for B

SYNOPSIS
      use B::Flags;
      print B::main_root->flagspv;
      print B::main_root->privatepv;
      print $some_b_sv_object->flagspv;

DESCRIPTION
    By default, "$foo->flags" when passed an object in the "B" class will
    produce a relatively meaningless number, which one would need to grovel
    through the Perl source code in order to do anything useful with. This
    module adds "flagspv" to the SV and op classes and "privatepv" to the op
    classes, which makes them easier to understand.

    Warning: This module is not *guaranteed* compatible with any version of
    Perl below 5.7.0; however, I'd like to make it so compatible, so if it
    fails to compile, mail me. There's probably an "#ifdef" I need to add
    somewhere...

METHODS
    OP->flagspv
        Returns stringification of the OP flags.

    OP->privatepv
        Returns stringification of the OP private flags.

    SV->flagspv [type]
        Returns stringification of the SV flags.

        With the optional type only the flags for the given SvTYPE are used.
        type 0 is for the SvFLAGS only. This way you can seperate between
        sv->FLAGS and specialized AvFLAGS, GvFLAGS, CvFLAGS, ... in seperate
        struct fields.
